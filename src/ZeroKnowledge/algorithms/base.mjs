// In JavaScript/Node.js, you might not have a direct equivalent of "register_algorithm" from the jwt library.
// You would typically create a map of algorithms to hash functions, but handling JWTs typically requires
// a specific library that provides this functionality.
// Below is a simple representation of how you might handle this:

// Map of algorithm names to hash functions
const hashFunctions = {};

// Function to register algorithm with its hash function
function registerAlgorithm(algorithm, hashFunction) {
    hashFunctions[algorithm] = hashFunction;
}

// Register each algorithm with its hash function
for (const [algorithm, hashName] of Object.entries(algorithms)) {
    registerAlgorithm(algorithm, HashTypes[hashName]);
}

// Usage example
